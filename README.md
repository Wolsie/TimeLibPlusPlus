# TimeLibPlusPlus
This repository is my attempt to take TimeLib.h and convert it to C++ class TimeClass as a virtual base class. The classes NISTClass and DS1307RTCClass are the derived class of TimeClass.
The code is quiclky hacked together and is work in progress. The complete code will need refactoring.
